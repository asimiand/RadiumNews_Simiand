        <p>Texas travel guides can lead explorers toward bustling cities, lazy beach towns and everything in between. But to know what might suit you best, it may be wise to consider how your personality plays into traveling.</p>

        <p>Are you extroverted, introverted or intuitive? Are you driven by feelings, thoughts, ideas or knowledge? Do you judge as you observe or embrace all of your surroundings? Are you a wallflower or the center of attention?</p>
        <p>The following is a rundown of the Texas locations best suited for each personality type.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- DALLAS -->
    <div class="images"><img src="images/Image 1.jpg" alt="Eric Laignel" width="760"></div>
    <div class="subtitles"><h3>ESTP: Dallas</h3></div>
    <div class = "box2"><p><strong>Extroverted, Observant, Thinking, and Prospecting:</strong> Dubbed the "Entrepreneur," ESTPs belong in the Big D. They enjoy discovering new opportunities that may arise from impassioned, dramatic discourse with fellow business-minded folks who don't speak under 85 decibels, lest someone not hear their groundbreaking new idea. This city's luxurious lodging, restaurants and shops will delight this traveler.
    </p></div>
    
    <!-- MARFA -->
    <div class="images"><img src="images/Image 2.jpg" alt="John Slaughter" width="760"></div>
    <div class="subtitles"><h3>ENFJ: Marfa</h3></div>
    <div class = "box2"><p><strong>Extroverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Judging: </strong>Strong-minded, loving and charismatic travelers will vibe easily with west Texas art Mecca Marfa, where they can immerse themselves in art installations, historic railroads, desert landscapes, educational centers and 
                <a href="https://www.chron.com/life/travel/texas/article/What-to-eat-see-and-do-in-Marfa-Texas-7243726.php" target = "_blank"> quirky lodging accommodations. </a>
                This traveler will enjoy the fun-meets-sophisticated dining scene here, which perfectly merges colorful settings with polished dishes. Enjoy drinks at countrified Lost Horse Saloon, a burger at El Camino, fine dining at Cochineal or inventive bites at Stellina.
    </p></div>

     
    <!-- Spanish Missions in Texas -->
    <div class="images"><img src="images/Image 3.jpg" alt="Eugatnom/flickr" width="760"></div>
    <div class="subtitles"><h3>INTJ: Spanish Missions in Texas</h3></div>
    <div class = "box2"><p><strong>Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Judging: </strong>
        This personality type is drawn to knowledge and is insightful, determined and innovative. A tour through Texas' 
        <a href="http://texasmissionguide.com/the-missions/" target="_blank">Spanish missions</a> will provide this traveler enough history to keep them entertained and engaged. While there are guides for these historic sites, an INTJ will likely tread a new path and discover some of the lesser known artifacts of this state.
    </p></div>
   
    <!-- Hamilton Pool -->
    <div class="images"><img src="images/Image 4.jpg" alt="GETTY / KRISTINE T PHAM PHOTOGRAPHY" width="760"></div>
    <div class="subtitles"><h3>INTP: Hamilton Pool</h3></div>
    <div class = "box2"><p><strong>Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Prospecting: </strong>
        This nature-loving person is characterized as independent and sensitive. A natural wonder, Hamilton Pool has a canopy of water that will entice this breed. A word of caution: this destination tends to be packed when it's open to travelers, but that's not necessarily an obstacle for an INTP because this person will prefer a solo trip.
    </p></div>

    <!-- Big Bend National Park -->
    <div class="images"><img src="images/Image 5.jpg" alt="Robert Daemmrich Photography Inc/Corbis via Getty Images" width="760"></div>
    <div class="subtitles"><h3>ENTJ: Big Bend National Park</h3></div>
    <div class = "box2"><p>
        <strong>Extroverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Judging: </strong>
        An ENTJ isn't shy and doesn't run from a challenge. This person will enjoy the sense of accomplishment that comes from mountain climbing or hiking at this expanse along the Chicos in this southwest Texas park. The Chihuahuan Desert leads to various wildlife observation pointsâ€”the perfect reward for this intrepid traveler.
    </p></div>

    <!-- Houston -->
    <div class="images"><img src="images/Image 6.jpg" alt="Elizabeth Conley, Houston Chronicle / Staff photographer" width="760"></div>
    <div class="subtitles"><h3>ENTP: Houston</h3></div>
    <div class = "box2"><p>
        <strong>Extroverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Prospecting:</strong>
        Often described as the "Debater," this smart, witty and opinionated person will enjoy visiting this city's many fascinating and unique places of worship, diverse restaurants, urban sprawl and educational sites. Head to the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center at NASA to satisfy an itch for knowledge, and embark on a food tour that will take you around the world from Pakistan to Oaxaca and Beijing to Bosnia without leaving the inner loop. Houston's political landscape also lends itself to the Debater, where a staunchly Republican base meets a Democratic audience from the inner city to the suburbs.
    </p></div>

    <!-- Bandera -->
    <div class="images"><img src="images/Image 7.jpg" alt="Melissa Ward Aguilar" width="760"></div>
    <div class="subtitles"><h3>ESFJ: Bandera</h3></div>
    <div class = "box2"><p>
        <strong>Extroverted, Observant, Feeling, and Judging: </strong>
        This explorer was probably the most popular person in school, with a keen sense of social intelligence, fashion flair and general determination to lead a party. This small Texas town merges country living and all of its Texas-style cowboy energy. Enjoy a swim with friends before "booting up" and hitting the local saloon.
    </p></div>

    <!-- Enchanted Rock -->
    <div class="images"><img src="images/Image 8.jpg" alt="Enchanted Rock" width="760"></div>
    <div class="subtitles"><h3>INFJ: Enchanted Rock</h3></div>
    <div class = "box2"><p>
        <strong>Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Judging: </strong>
        This is the least common personality type on the Myers-Briggs spectrum. Drawn to contemplative, quiet and mystical places, an INFJ will feel right at home at the Fredericksburg-adjacent pink granite mound in the Llano Uplift. Native American tribes used to refer to this geological wonder as a "holy portal to other worlds," and history surrounds the area, including stories of Spanish priests and dueling Native American tribes.
    </p></div>

    <!-- Fredericksburg -->
    <div class="images"><img src="images/Image 9.jpg" alt="Fredericksburg Herb Farm / Fredericksburg Herb Farm" width="760"></div>
    <div class="subtitles"><h3>INFP: Fredericksburg</h3></div>
    <div class = "box2"><p>
        <strong>Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Prospecting: </strong>
        INFPs will feel welcome in this small German town founded in 1846. This tourist is described as warm, communicative and generally personable. This traveler might become lifelong friends with their German-cottage Airbnb host. New friends will be inevitable as you venture through the German architectural tours, quaint shops and wineries.
    </p></div>

    <!-- La grange -->
    <div class="images"><img src="images/Image 10.jpg" alt="James Nielsen/Staff Photographer" width="760"></div>
    <div class="subtitles"><h3>ISTP: La Grange</h3></div>
    <div class = "box2"><p>
        <strong>Introverted, Observant, Thinking, and Prospecting: </strong>
        This voyager would enjoy examining a place like La Grange, a small city nestled between Austin and Houston that could double as a movie set for a wild-west flick. You may know it from its pop culture impact: a 1973 song by ZZ Top and the infamous 1979 musical "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas," (along with the '82 movie that followed). An ISTP will love seeing, smelling and tasting all the small-town-meets-culture destinations in this pocket of Texas life.
